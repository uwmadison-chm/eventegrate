# Eventegrate

Automate sharing of a service account's Google calendars to people,
so we can all share one room reservation and calendaring system across both
CHM and HMI

## Usage

Use the Google API dashboard to get a JSON file of credentials and put it 
here, named `credentials.json`.

Then when you run the first time, a browser will open.

Login as `community_chm@wisc.edu` or whatever, and allow Eventegrate access.
